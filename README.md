# Trees Visualization

This project implements three different types of tree data structures: AVL Trees, Binary Search Trees, and B-Trees. It provides functionality to insert, delete, and traverse the trees, as well as print their structure.

## Language and Libraries

- **Language**: C
- **Version**: C99

## Libraries Used

- stdio.h
- stdlib.h
- stdbool.h

## AVL Tree

The AVL Tree implementation includes functions for node creation, insertion, deletion, inorder traversal, and printing the tree structure. AVL Trees are self-balancing binary search trees that ensure efficient operations with O(log n) time complexity.

## Binary Search Tree

The Binary Search Tree implementation includes functions for node creation, insertion, deletion, inorder traversal, and printing the tree structure. Binary Search Trees offer O(log n) average time complexity for operations but may degrade to O(n) in worst-case scenarios.

## B-Tree

The B-Tree implementation includes functions for node creation, insertion, deletion, inorder traversal, and printing the tree structure. B-Trees are self-balancing tree data structures with O(log n) time complexity for operations, offering efficient storage and retrieval of sorted data.

### Key Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Inorder Traversal
- Printing Tree Structure

## Improvements Needed

1. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling mechanisms.
2. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper memory deallocation.
3. **Function Documentation**: Add comments to enhance code readability.
4. **Additional Functionality**: Consider adding features like key searching and tree balancing.
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests for code correctness.

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of tree data structures and their implementation. With the suggested improvements, it can become more robust and user-friendly.

### Instructions for Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the source code files.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project directory.

3. **Compile the Code**: Compile the main source code file using the `gcc` compiler.

4. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program using the `./main` command.

By providing these files and instructions, users can easily clone the repository, compile the code, and run the program in their Bash environment.
